                Born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California, 
                Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio is the only child of Irmelin and George DiCaprio. 
                His parents divorced when he was still a toddler. DiCaprio was mostly raised by his mother, 
                a legal secretary born in Germany. Despite his parents' early divorce, 
                DiCaprio remained close to his father, a comic book artist and distributor. 
                With his parents' urging, DiCaprio explored his creative side, developing an early interest in acting. 
                <em>"I loved imitating people ... I loved joking around with my parents and creating different characters. 
                I liked doing my own little homemade skits,"</em> DiCaprio told Backstage. 
                But he didn't have much success in Hollywood until he reached his early teens.

        DiCaprio's parents named him Leonardo because his pregnant mother first felt him kick while she was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy.
        At the beginning of his career, DiCaprio had difficulty finding an agent. When he found one, he suggested DiCaprio change his name to Lenny Williams to appeal to American audiences, 
        which he declined to do. DiCaprio remained jobless for a year and a half, even after 100 auditions. Following this lack of success, 
        DiCaprio decided to give up acting but his father persuaded him to persevere with it. Motivated by his father and financial security, 
        he continued to audition; after a talent agent, who knew his mother's friend, recommended him to casting directors, 
        DiCaprio secured roles in about 20 commercials.

            The huge success of Titanic showed that DiCaprio could handle traditional Hollywood leading man roles. 
            He quickly became a world-famous celebrity with a growing following of admirers, 
            his charm and youthful good looks landing him on People magazine's list of the "50 Most Beautiful People" in 1997 and 1998.
