# Precourse Final-Project
## Leonardo Di Caprio Tribute Website

### Description
This is my first ever project created from scratch as a part of DI-Bootcamp Precourse aiming to practice all the notions I've learned during the
Bootcamp Prep +.

### Instruction
I had to use only HTML and CSS. The tribute page should include the timeline of the life of the person, or some importants events.

### Main goals
#### In HTML
1. To create a well structured HTML file, with comments that explain the layout.
2. To remove all unnecessary div elements. Include semantic elements like header, footer, article, aside into the structure.
3. To add different types of text to the web page to practice headings, lists, and links.
4. To change emphasis on text using bold and italics.
5. To insert an image and add image captions.

#### In CSS
1. To use classes and ids.
2. To use Google Fonts.
3. To use layout properties (display and/or position and/or float and/or flexbox).
